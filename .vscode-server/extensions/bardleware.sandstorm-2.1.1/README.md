# **Sandstorm Color Theme**
### _A theme for working late into the night_

A few nights ago, I realized how it might be nice to have a theme that didn't have a bluey tint but also didn't burn your eyes out with how much red there was. The result of this desiring is the Sandstorm color theme. Its like that one song that's played at youth gatherings where you get this over-inflated notion that you can do anything in the world...except that now the thing is program late into the night and it's no longer an over-inflated notion.

I am open to tweaks and adjustments to make the theme better.

## What's new in version

1. Two color themes: 
  * classic - the original Sandstorm theme with no changes
  * darker - a darker spin on the classic theme

2. Edited some typos in the readme and deleted the screenshots.
_will the screenshots return?_ **yes**

## Why did we jump from `0.6.0` to `2.0.0`?

Because I ran into some issues and I'm still kinda new at building extensions.


## Where do we go from here?

* add Specificity in token colors
* refine classic theme
* add screenshots with theme colors.
* add build system to generate theme
