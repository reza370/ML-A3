# README

This is a theme for people who like C# intellisense and VS Code but not the theming. If you used monodevelop before you know that its monokai theme is great! So I remade it in VS Code. And this theme is not meant for anything but C# so you should get the "Theme by Language" extension by Julien Saulou and make this theme the default for C# and also make sure to get the "Identical Sublime Monokai C# theme and colorizer" by Maximetinu because it helps with some of the syntax highlighting.

If you want semantic so it looks even more like Monodevelop add this to your settings.json!

```json
"editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations": {
    "enabled": true // enable for all themes
}
```
